## About the Collection
{% include feature/image.html objectid="cb-019" %} 
The Children’s Book Collection (1800–1980) is a digital archive highlighting the evolution of children’s literature over two centuries. Featuring about 25 titles—from fairy tales to early readers—the collection includes classics like Cinderella and The Secret Garden. Some books contain only cover images, while others include full stories or sample pages in PDF form. Each item is described with detailed metadata, offering educators, researchers, and readers insight into how children’s stories have shaped imagination, values, and learning across generations.
